1. Create a new file in the same repository where you have created the post-commit hook script  
**touch test2.md**
2. Add and commit this new file which will trigger the post-commit hook and thus, the corresponding webpage mentioned in the post-commit file will open up immediately  
**git add test2.md  
git commit -m "Testing the working of the post-commit Hook script"**
